# AutoQuant V2 current status

Status: `v0.9.28` is the current AutoQuant release candidate and `v0.8.31`
remains the Harness currently consumed by OpenAlice until the host deliberately
selects a newer tag.

Updated: 2026-08-02.

This document describes only the current checkout's tested capability and
honest boundary. Concise release history lives in [[docs/CHANGELOG]]; exact
historical proof remains in completed plans and immutable Git tags.

## Current milestone

The `0.9.28` candidate makes the Factor outcome caller-owned. A strict request
can bind either `forward-return` or `forward-realized-volatility`; omission in
preserved historical requests and claims remains implicit forward return
without rewriting immutable evidence. The risk outcome is the unannualized
square root of summed squared close-to-close log returns over the next complete
observed-base-bar window. A larger Factor always predicts a larger bound
outcome.

The existing purged 60/20/20 evaluation, rank and Pearson association,
dependence-aware inference, chronological folds, regimes, style overlap,
component evidence, visible-test discipline, Reports, CLI, and Studio now carry
that exact outcome. Risk prediction supports one temporal target or at least
four cross-sectional assets in standalone Factor Lab. It deliberately rejects
two-asset relative-value and three-asset basket interpretations.

A statistically supported risk forecast ends further in-sample tuning and
routes to a frozen external holdout. It has no expected-return, Portfolio, RL,
Order, or trading authority. Portfolio and governed RL independently require a
forward-return claim, preventing a high-risk score from silently becoming a
long signal or target weight.

The existing V6 surface continues to preserve byte-exact, per-source provider
authority across compatible close-time-aware packages. V5/V6 retain exact
completed-close, observed-only, absent-no-fill, one-target semantics, and
candidate code must express asynchronous context through explicit causal
backward as-of operations. Core never manufactures a common calendar or
implicit fill.

Candidate deterministic tests and cross-surface regression pass. The installed
wheel field trial, complete release audit, and remote tag identity remain the
active release gate; exact evolving proof is retained in
[[plans/caller-owned-factor-outcomes]].

The root sample preserves seventeen historical Runs without rewriting old
results and projects clean `0.9.27` Factor and Portfolio evidence through the
new outcome boundary. OpenAlice remains independently pinned to `v0.8.31`.

## What works today

| Research need | Current route | Lifecycle |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cross-sectional or temporal factor research | `ohlcv-factor-lab` | editable candidate, bounded Session, validation-only selection |
| factor-to-target portfolio research | `ohlcv-portfolio-lab` | editable factor source, fixed construction and accounting |
| adaptive policy value beyond fixed factor sleeves | `ohlcv-rl-factor-lab` | editable causal encoder, fixed actions/reward/risk, bounded seeds and folds |
| coordinated Factor → Portfolio → optional RL investigation | `ohlcv-research-desk` | multiple Studies in one persistent Project |
| historical volatility, drawdown, and covariance risk of one reported or hypothetical funded book | `ohlcv-book-risk-lab` | fixed Study, no candidate Session |
| caller-authored complete book scenarios or one-leg cash sizing | `ohlcv-book-risk-lab` | fixed bounded authority, no optimizer or Order |
| OHLCV-observable conditional price event | `ohlcv-event-study-lab` | fixed event ledger and references, no candidate Session |
| non-predictive strategic risk-parity allocation | `ohlcv-allocation-lab` | fixed ERC Study and fixed-weight reference, no Factor/RL Session |
| strictly later external-period challenge | frozen holdout flow | one-shot immutable audit, no new selection |

The common Portfolio Core covers caller-owned asset roles, gross and per-asset
caps, cash, benchmarks, decision cadence, market-clock anchors,
scale-down-only covariance volatility control, drift, no-trade handling,
linear traded-notional cost, capacity diagnostics, contribution accounting,
position lifecycles, and validation/test authority.

## Data and market surfaces proven

The current OHLCV contracts have been exercised with:

- aligned adjusted XNYS daily panels;
- calendar-verified XNYS intraday sessions and early closes;
- continuous UTC Crypto bars;
- configurable base intervals and causally completed higher intervals;
- observed-only ragged daily and mixed-class intraday panels;
- exact close-time asynchronous cross-market daily panels;
- exact per-asset provider provenance across compatible V5 source packages;
- long-only, short-only, two-sided, and context-only asset roles.

CSV works in the base environment. Parquet and Feather are optional. Provider,
adjustment, observed-calendar, close-time, continuous-series, and event-label
claims remain explicit input authority rather than facts silently invented by
AutoQuant.

## AI operator experience

The primary operator is a coding Agent; the human owns intent, review, and
collaboration. The workbench supplies:

- recoverable English `research.md` problem definition and clarification;
- Project-local `framework-needs.md` for reusable Workbench gaps;
- machine-readable capability, schema, orientation, and exact-next-action
  discovery;
- ordinary pandas factor code rather than a proprietary factor DSL;
- deterministic preflight before complete evaluation;
- disposable Session worktrees with a declared editable closure;
- bounded Judge, Campaign, fold, seed, turn, and wall-clock execution;
- immutable KEEP/REVERT/CRASH evidence and guarded promotion;
- strict Explorers that independently reconcile artifacts;
- one read-only Studio projection over the same verified Core loaders;
- durable files, manifests, Git, Runs, Reports, Reviews, and Dossiers that let
  another Agent resume without private chat history.

Fixed research routes expose no fictional editable Session. A negative result
is evidence; invalid input, authority violation, timeout, or corrupt artifact
remains a structured failure.

## Real-request proof

Field trials cover materially different delegated questions: U.S. selection,
global allocation, hourly crypto timing, relative value, reported-book risk,
hypothetical funding alternatives, fixed price events, mixed-class Factors,
cross-market acquisition, persistent-Project follow-ups, independent Review,
frozen holdout, and clarification-first delegation.

The canonical results, Run identifiers, versions, and limitations are preserved
in [[docs/trading-request-field-trials]]. The methodology for judging whether a
fresh coworker was actually employable is in
[[docs/agent-employability-validation]].

## Honest boundary

AutoQuant is not a broker, live account, OMS, universal backtesting SDK, hosted
data service, or catalogue of every quantitative method. It does not own:

- broker credentials, authenticated positions, approvals, tax lots, margin,
  borrow, venue capability, live reconciliation, or order submission;
- silent data acquisition or authentication of provider adjustment, roll,
  survivorship, corporate-action, calendar, or labelled-event semantics;
- arbitrary optimizers, every ML model, high-frequency order-book simulation,
  or a universal asset DSL;
- the final execution conversation between current account state, user intent,
  and live venue constraints.

In OpenAlice, UTA and the investment-research conversation can consume
AutoQuant evidence without moving live-trading authority into the quant desk.

## Known product gaps

- The first-class method catalogue remains intentionally narrow; general
  supervised ML, richer portfolio constructors, clustering/HRP, probabilistic
  models, and other methods should follow demonstrated research demand.
- External OHLCV acquisition and package preparation still require Agent
  judgment. The public Skill now covers one observed daily close-time
  materialization route without turning Core into a downloader.
- Studio is a verified observation surface, not a full interactive research
  authoring or orchestration UI.
- OpenAlice remains deliberately pinned to `0.8.31`; host-side adoption of a
  later release is independent of package publication.
- Fixed Studies, Session Reports, and multi-lane Dossiers do not collapse into
  one universal outward-deliverable type.

## Next use

Continue driving `0.9.x` from bounded real assignments and Project-local
`framework-needs.md`. Prefer correctness and Agent operability over speculative
surface or pre-1.0 compatibility; [[PLANS]] owns the next active item when one
is selected.
