## Scope

This document owns the first fixed portfolio Judge and reference Project:
causal signal timing, target-weight construction, portfolio accounting,
transaction-cost and capacity proxies, professional metric layers, stress
tests, artifacts, and candidate authority.

It does not own live orders, Broker/UTA state, L2 fills, intrabar TPSL, capital
allocation across OpenAlice users, or a universal portfolio optimizer.

## Candidate and Judge boundary

The Agent edits one ordinary pandas function:

```python
def compute_factor(frame: pandas.DataFrame) -> pandas.Series:
    ...
```

It receives one asset's chronological OHLCV frame and returns an aligned
numeric Series. It may create NaNs during warmup but may not mutate input,
return infinity, change alignment, or depend on future rows. Prefix
re-evaluation at multiple cuts audits causality.

The fixed Judge owns:

- next-bar close-to-close targets and returns;
- cross-sectional percentile entry/hold/exit/reversal state;
- conviction and trailing inverse-volatility risk sizing;
- causal trailing-covariance portfolio-volatility scale-down;
- the fixed request-derived tradable/context universe, permitted direction,
  cash, gross/net rules, caller/default structured benchmark, and
  caller/default per-asset cap;
- caller/default no-trade tolerance, base cost, reference NAV, drift,
  turnover, and volume participation;
- dataset-fixed purged chronological splits, benchmark, metrics, contribution
  attribution, stresses, and primary score.

The candidate cannot improve by changing portfolio machinery.

## Timing and target construction

For decision date `t`:

```text
OHLCV known through close t
→ candidate factor(t) and cross-sectional percentile
→ request-permitted entry/hold/exit signal intent
→ conviction divided by trailing 20-bar realized volatility known at t
→ allocate long/cash, short/cash, or equal-sided dollar-neutral budget
→ cap each absolute target at the Mandate cap; unused budget is cash
→ forecast annualized portfolio volatility from at most 60 return rows through t
→ scale the complete target down to the Mandate ceiling; never scale up
→ context-only assets remain flat with zero target
→ compare with the prior book drifted through return t
→ retain the drifted book below the Mandate no-trade band
→ otherwise rebalance at close t
→ recheck the chosen final book under the same causal covariance ceiling
→ if excessive, bypass no-trade with minimum proportional scale-down
→ earn close(t)→close(t+1) return
```

This is a `bar-target-weight simulation`. It does not claim a particular
intraday fill, queue priority, spread path, or order type.

The request-derived Portfolio Mandate decides which assets and signs may
become positions. Directional families water-fill permitted active strength
up to the gross limit and retain unused budget in cash. Dollar-neutral
families treat positive and negative scores separately and require both
equal gross sides to fund exactly; otherwise the target is flat rather than
silently changing net exposure. Exact state, threshold, conviction,
risk-strength, and allocation semantics are
[[docs/design/signal-policy-and-attribution]].

The immutable decision ledger deliberately stores every primitive needed to
audit that allocator: percentile score, conviction, trailing volatility,
risk strength, raw target, governor scale, governed target, executed weight,
and covariance component contribution. The bounded `sizingAnatomy` projection
reconstructs the same-side proportional allocation and cap redistribution
from those primitives. It is a read model of the fixed Judge—not a second
optimizer—and is defined in [[docs/design/portfolio-decision-explorer]].
The same immutable ledger supports a separate current/split diversification
read model: component-risk concentration, effective risk bets, and a fixed
25% / 50% / 100% covariance blend toward perfect position-aligned correlation.
It is defined in [[docs/design/portfolio-diversification-stress]] and never
changes allocation.

The same read model reconstructs `strategyViability` from daily gross return,
traded notional, cost, net return, and benchmark. It reconciles the fixed cost
stress and separates absent factor edge, failed gross monetization, and
cost-fragile implementation before suggesting a bounded research layer to
inspect. The diagnosis never changes this Judge's objective or verdict.

## Drift, turnover, costs, and participation

Before choosing the target at close `t`, the prior target is drifted by the
asset returns realized from `t-1` to `t` and normalized by portfolio gross
return. The trade vector is proposed or retained target minus that drifted
book.

- `one_way_turnover = 0.5 * sum(abs(trade_weight))`;
- `traded_notional = sum(abs(trade_weight))`;
- cost is `traded_notional * one_way_cost_bps / 10_000`;
- participation is absolute trade dollars divided by close times volume under
  the Mandate's research reference NAV.

The factor-of-two distinction is explicit: turnover reports portfolio
replacement fraction, while cost applies to every bought or sold dollar.
OHLCV volume supports only a coarse participation proxy, not a market-impact
or capacity guarantee.

## Evidence layers

### Factor

- coverage;
- chronological rank IC mean, ICIR, hit rate, and observations;
- top-minus-bottom forward-return spread.

### Portfolio and risk

- total return, annualized return and volatility;
- Sharpe, Sortino, maximum drawdown, Calmar;
- 95% expected shortfall and positive-period rate;
- benchmark beta, active annualized return, tracking error, and information
  ratio.

### Implementation

- mean/annualized one-way turnover and traded notional;
- total cost drag and rebalance/no-trade rates;
- average/max gross and net exposure;
- average/max absolute asset weight and concentration HHI;
- mean/max volume participation at the fixed reference NAV.
- causal 20-observation dollar-volume capacity at 1%/5% participation,
  trade-date coverage, reference-NAV breach rate, and binding assets.
- final-book forecast coverage, pretrade breaches, risk-only no-trade
  overrides, and zero available executed breaches.

### Robustness

- dataset-fixed, one-bar-purged 60/20/20 train, validation, and visible
  diagnostic test splits;
- net results under 0, 10, and 25 basis-point cost assumptions;
- one additional bar of signal delay;
- governed hysteresis versus a fixed no-hysteresis state baseline;
- a predeclared five-profile by three-band local parameter neighborhood with
  exact validation/test paths and no selection authority;
- annualized per-asset gross contribution;
- attribution by asset, signal intent, and causal regime;
- complete deterministic daily returns, proposed/executed weights, and
  per-asset decision artifacts.

The primary `validation_net_sharpe` is validation net Sharpe under the base
10 basis-point cost assumption. Test and stress metrics remain mandatory
visible evidence but never enter KEEP/REVERT. Candidate iteration after
inspecting them requires a new external holdout for a fresh production-grade
claim. See [[docs/design/research-selection-integrity]].

## Benchmark

The fixed benchmark follows the Portfolio Mandate. If the caller supplies
`benchmarkPolicy`, it is cash or one unlevered long dataset asset such as SPY.
Otherwise Core records the direction-derived default:

- long: equal-weight long requested/tradable assets;
- short: equal-weight short requested/tradable assets;
- long-short and relative-value: cash;
- synthetic research-only: equal-weight long research universe.

The Mandate materializes one complete full-universe weight vector, and every
bar uses its dot product with next-bar asset returns. A context-only benchmark
never becomes a position. It is not a tradable recommendation. Beta, active
return, tracking error, and information ratio use the exact same chronological
dates as the evaluated portfolio. See
[[docs/design/caller-owned-benchmark-reference]].

## Artifacts

Every successful Run declares:

- `portfolio-report.json`: assumptions, split metrics, stresses, per-asset
  contribution, constraint audit, and causality cuts;
- `daily-portfolio.csv`: gross/net/benchmark returns, turnover, cost,
  exposures, unused cash budget, rebalance state, and participation;
- `proposed-target-weights.csv`: exact state-policy targets;
- `executed-weights.csv`: exact post-band per-date asset weights;
- `portfolio-decisions.csv`: exact mandate id, tradability, permitted
  direction, signal intent, raw/governed sizing, covariance forecast and
  scale, execution, return, cost, regime, component-risk, causal ADV,
  participation-capacity, and binding-asset ledger.
- `portfolio-parameter-neighborhood.json`: exact validation/test net return,
  turnover, cost, rebalance, and signal-transition paths for every predeclared
  signal-profile and no-trade-band cell.

RunResult remains the immutable authority for artifact identities.

`aq run portfolio` and Studio's latest-Run Portfolio Decision Explorer consume
these artifacts through the strict bounded projection defined in
[[docs/design/portfolio-decision-explorer]]. Full chronology is verified and
reconciled before display sampling; the browser never reads artifact paths.

## Invariants

1. Factor and portfolio values at date `t` use no data after close `t`.
2. Returns credited to a target begin strictly after its decision timestamp.
3. Candidate code never controls targets, costs, benchmark, splits, metrics, or
   score.
4. Every asset/date has an explicit signal event and allocation status.
5. Tradable/context assets, direction, cash, gross/net exposure, benchmark,
   and caps are explicit and audited.
6. Turnover and cost conventions are reported separately.
7. Aggregate performance retains split, per-asset, implementation, attribution,
   and stress
   evidence.
8. Contribution, cost, trade, and component-risk evidence reconciles daily.
9. Validation alone owns candidate selection; test is visible diagnostic
   evidence.
10. The simulation emits target weights only and has no trading authority.
11. OHLCV capacity is a contextual participation envelope, not an impact or
    fill guarantee, and never enters selection.
12. Routine tests use a small deterministic OHLCV fixture.
13. Final post-drift weights, not only targets, obey the request-bound risk
    ceiling whenever its causal forecast is available.

## Change checklist

- State decision and return timestamps for every accounting change.
- Prove allocator constraints and drift/turnover/cost identities with focused
  deterministic tests.
- Keep all portfolio mechanics in the fixed Judge closure.
- Update template discovery, Study/Run docs, Studio interpretation, package
  assets, and known-improvement/lookahead tests together.
- Do not add a metric without defining its annualization, sign, benchmark, and
  finite-value behavior.

## Known gaps

- V2 has fixed request-mapped long/cash, short/cash, and dollar-neutral
  families, not arbitrary optimizer constraints or a strategy DSL.
- Costs are linear and the capacity envelope is a trailing-dollar-volume
  participation proxy; spread, impact, borrow, funding, and futures margin are
  absent.
- Corporate actions, calendar metadata, and production price adjustments
  remain outside the synthetic fixture.
- The implemented parameter neighborhood is deliberately local and
  context-only. Correlated-grid effective trial count, PBO, and automatic
  optimization remain absent.
- The V1 risk governor uses sample covariance and a fixed ceiling. Shrinkage,
  stress covariance, risk-parity solving, and caller-approved risk budgets are
  separate work.
