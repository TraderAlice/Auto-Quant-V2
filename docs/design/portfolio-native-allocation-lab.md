## Purpose

`ohlcv-allocation-lab` answers a portfolio-construction question that does not
contain a return forecast. It must not invent a Factor merely because the
existing Portfolio Lab starts from factor scores.

V1 supports exactly one caller-fixed method:

- long-only equal risk contribution (`equal-risk-contribution`);
- trailing completed-return covariance;
- one caller-fixed covariance window and minimum history;
- one caller-fixed contribution tolerance;
- caller-owned gross and per-asset caps;
- a scale-down-only annualized volatility ceiling;
- one complete funded non-negative `fixed-weights` reference portfolio.

This is a deliberately narrow construction contract, not an optimizer registry.
Expected-return models, efficient frontiers, Black-Litterman, HRP, shorts,
leverage targeting, tax lots, Orders, and account truth remain outside it.

## Request boundary

An Allocation request requires:

1. `direction: long`;
2. every requested asset explicitly classified `long-only` or `context-only`;
3. `portfolioPolicy`, including the decision schedule, costs, no-trade band,
   reference NAV, caps, and volatility ceiling;
4. `allocationPolicy` with exactly:
   `kind`, `covarianceWindow`, `minimumObservations`,
   `contributionTolerance`, and `scaleUp: false`;
5. `benchmarkPolicy.kind: fixed-weights` with positive weights that sum to one
   and name only requested long-only assets.

Public intake rejects partial roles, unfunded or unknown benchmark legs,
unsupported allocation fields, non-long authority, and attempts to combine the
route with Factor, event, position-snapshot, or position-sizing authority.

Intake materializes `strategies/allocation-policy.json`. The dependency freezes
the normalized request hash, method, complete universe, tradable/context
partition, Portfolio policy, reference, annualization, validation-only selection
rule, and `tradingAuthority: none`.

## Causal construction

At each caller-scheduled decision close `t`:

1. use returns through and including `t`, never later rows;
2. take at most the fixed trailing covariance window;
3. remain in cash until the fixed minimum complete history exists;
4. solve the positive equal-risk-budgeting objective with deterministic
   cyclical coordinate descent;
5. normalize to unit gross and project onto caller-owned upper caps;
6. recompute component-variance shares after projection;
7. label the decision `within-tolerance` only when the maximum absolute
   contribution-share error is within the fixed tolerance; otherwise label it
   `cap-induced-parity-gap`;
8. apply the existing Portfolio Core final-book constraints and scale-down-only
   volatility governor.

A cap can make exact parity infeasible. The Workbench preserves the funded
capped book and its measured parity error; it never calls that result exact
risk parity.

## Complete reference path

The fixed-weight reference is not a daily dot product and not a named security.
It is simulated as an independent portfolio:

- target weights are offered on the same decision schedule;
- weights drift between decisions;
- the same no-trade band and linear traded-notional cost apply;
- reference legs may drift beyond their target weights between rebalances;
- candidate caps and the candidate volatility ceiling do not govern the
  reference;
- both paths earn only the close after the decision close.

This prevents the candidate from being compared with a costless, continuously
rebalanced approximation of the caller's reference.

## Evidence and selection

The fixed Study has no editable source and no Session lifecycle. One successful
Run publishes:

- `allocation-report.json`;
- `allocation-daily.csv`;
- `allocation-target-weights.csv`;
- `allocation-executed-weights.csv`;
- `allocation-reference-weights.csv`;
- `allocation-decisions.csv`.

The immutable report contains chronological 60/20/20 splits. The conclusion is
selected only from validation candidate-minus-reference net Sharpe. Test is
visible audit only and cannot reverse the conclusion.

`aq run allocation` verifies the Run inventory and frozen dependency, then
independently rederives split performance, costs, turnover, volatility
breaches, role/cap/gross compliance, solver counts, latest target/executed/
reference weights, component-risk shares, parity error, the end-of-dataset
drifted book, whether an ordinary rebalance is due, and validation-only
conclusion authority. Studio consumes the same strict read model.

After the current fixed Run succeeds, orientation has no primary CLI action
and explicitly hands off to an Agent-owned written answer. The Allocation
Explorer remains one supporting read-only action for evidence inspection; it
does not imply another construction or evaluation is required.

Latest weights are mechanical historical research targets. They are not
authenticated holdings, Orders, TPSL instructions, future-volatility
guarantees, or trading authority.
