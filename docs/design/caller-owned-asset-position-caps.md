## Purpose

The collaborating workbench owns intended research exposure constraints;
AutoQuant owns reproducible signal-to-position mechanics.

```text
Research Request.portfolioPolicy.assetMaxAbsWeights
→ complete content-addressed Portfolio Mandate cap vector
→ shared Portfolio / governed-RL capped water-fill
→ immutable target, constraint, sizing, Report, and Dossier evidence
```

Candidate factor and encoder code cannot edit this chain.

## Request contract

A supplied complete `portfolioPolicy` adds:

```json
{
  "grossLimit": 0.8,
  "maxAbsWeight": 0.25,
  "assetMaxAbsWeights": {
    "AAPL": 0.12,
    "NVDA": 0.08,
    "SPY": 0.25
  },
  "annualizedVolatilityCeiling": 0.12,
  "baseCostBps": 15.0,
  "noTradeOneWay": 0.04,
  "referenceNav": 250000.0,
  "decisionEveryBars": 4,
  "decisionAnchor": "dataset-start"
}
```

The map may be empty. Every key must be one of `request.assets`; every value
must be a finite non-boolean number in `(0, maxAbsWeight]`. An asset without an
override uses the global cap.

When `portfolioPolicy` is omitted, the reference default remains global
`0.30` with no overrides.

## Mandate contract

`construction.assetMaxAbsWeights` is a complete object keyed in exact research
universe order:

- each tradable asset receives its caller override or the global cap;
- each context-only asset receives `0.0`;
- no unknown or missing asset is allowed.

The scalar `construction.maxAbsWeight` remains the fallback and maximum
permitted value. The complete map, request hash, Mandate id, dependency hash,
Study input, Session authority, and Run identity all change together.

## Mechanical allocation

For one active side with positive strengths `s_i`, target budget `B`, and
individual caps `c_i`, the fixed allocator repeatedly assigns proportional
weights and freezes every name whose proposed weight exceeds its own cap:

```text
remaining proposal_i = s_i / Σs × remaining budget
if proposal_i > c_i:
    weight_i = c_i
    remove i
    remaining budget -= c_i
repeat
```

Directional families allocate up to `min(B, Σ active c_i)` and retain the
unfunded amount as cash. Dollar-neutral families require each side to fund its
exact fixed side budget; if either side's active cap capacity is insufficient,
the complete target stays flat.

The covariance risk governor remains one-sided and may only scale these
already-cap-compliant raw targets down. Drift/no-trade retention may temporarily
leave historical executed weights different from current targets; final risk
compliance remains separately authoritative. Caps constrain proposed targets,
not live UTA holdings.

## Evidence

Portfolio and governed RL freeze:

- the complete cap vector inside the Portfolio Mandate;
- per-asset target cap and maximum excess in constraint evidence;
- active-side aggregate cap capacity and binding assets;
- each current asset's own cap, proportional pre-cap weight, raw target,
  covariance-governed target, executed historical research weight, and
  at-cap/cap-applied status.

Reports, Dossiers, CLI, and Studio must distinguish the global fallback from
named overrides. They retain `quantitative-decision-support` and
`tradingAuthority: none`.

## Invariants

1. Overrides name requested assets only.
2. Every tradable universe asset has one positive cap no greater than the
   global cap; every context-only asset has cap zero.
3. Water-filling uses the exact per-asset vector for every Portfolio and RL
   sleeve.
4. Proposed targets never exceed their named caps.
5. Directional unused capacity remains cash; dollar-neutral side underfunding
   remains flat.
6. Candidate code cannot tune caps or reinterpret zero as tradable authority.
7. Risk scaling may reduce but never increase a cap-compliant target.
8. Current executed weights remain historical research evidence, never a live
   holdings or order claim.

## Known limits

- This contract does not express minimum allocations, forced positions,
  hedge ratios, sector/factor exposure, or correlated group limits. Named sign
  permissions are separately owned by
  [[docs/design/caller-owned-asset-position-roles]].
- Caps are caller constraints, not estimates of optimal Kelly size, liquidity,
  expected return, or confidence.
- Any live-trading authority still owns account authorization and
  reconciliation against actual positions.
