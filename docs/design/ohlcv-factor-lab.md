# OHLCV Factor Lab reference Project

Status: V1 reference Project implemented.

Related: [[docs/ARCHITECTURE]], [[docs/PROJECT_FORMAT]], [[docs/CLI]],
[[docs/design/workspace-project-boundaries]],

[[docs/design/factor-diagnostics]], and
[[docs/design/research-session-loop]].

## Scope

This document owns the first executable quantitative reference Project:
transactional template construction, its deterministic OHLCV fixture, the
editable factor API, fixed factor-quality Judge, research objective, and
bounded validation semantics.

It does not define a universal market-data format, Broker simulator, portfolio
optimizer, live-trading interface, production alpha claim, or framework-wide
factor DSL.

## Construction boundary

`ohlcv-factor-lab` is a Project creation template, not a runtime parent.
Construction stages the ordinary Project plus every template-owned file in the
Workspace's hidden creation directory, validates the completed Project and
Study, then atomically renames it into discovery.

The resulting Project owns:

```text
research.md
factors/candidate.py
judges/ohlcv_factor.py
studies/ohlcv-factor-quality/
data/ohlcv/<asset>.csv
```

No created Project imports template resources from the installed AutoQuant
package. The small synthetic dataset is generated deterministically during
construction rather than bundled as a large static asset.

`blank` remains the default Project construction mode. Selecting a template is
explicit and machine-discoverable through the CLI capability contract.

## Dataset contract

The reference Study opts into the content-locked dataset contract from
[[docs/design/study-run-evidence]] with a Project-data-relative trailing
closure:

```json
{
  "paths": ["ohlcv/**"]
}
```

Every matched regular file participates in `datasetHash`. Symlinks, traversal,
missing exact files, empty closures, and matches outside the canonical Project
data root are rejected.

The Session candidate worktree remains data-less. Canonical and worktree Study
identity both hash the owning Project's data root, and the Judge reads that
same root through `AUTOQUANT_DATA_ROOT`. A data change therefore stales the
Session rather than silently changing its evaluation population.

## Editable factor API

The Agent may edit only `factors/candidate.py`. It exports:

```python
def compute_factor(panel: pandas.DataFrame) -> pandas.Series:
    ...
```

`panel` contains the complete Study universe in chronological long form. Each
row has `asset`, `timestamp`, `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, and `volume`,
plus configured completed higher-interval columns. Candidate code may use
within-asset history and cross-asset context at the same or an earlier
completed timestamp. Asynchronous context requires an explicit backward
as-of operation. The returned
Series must:

- have the same index and length as the input;
- contain numeric values or missing warm-up values;
- derive each value only from its timestamp and prior timestamps;
- avoid mutating the input;
- avoid reading Project data, Judge output, or environment-owned evaluation
  state directly.

The API deliberately uses ordinary pandas and NumPy expressions. AutoQuant
does not wrap them in a legacy event/line abstraction. The canonical details
are in [[docs/design/panel-native-factor-api]].

New Projects receive a surface-aligned API demonstrator. For a real caller
assignment, the Agent replaces it with the first predeclared caller-relevant
candidate before any evaluation; it does not inspect the demonstrator's
visible test audit and then edit the real candidate. The candidate records
`AVAILABLE_FEATURE_INTERVALS` from the content-locked dataset snapshot; daily
or observed-only packages therefore begin with only `base_momentum_10`, while
available 3h, 12h, and 1d bars enable their matching reference components.
This is baseline construction, not request-specific factor selection, and the
preflight still rejects any Agent declaration that exceeds the fixed panel
surface.

## Fixed Judge semantics

The Judge owns target construction and evaluation:

1. Load and strictly validate each declared OHLCV CSV.
2. Combine the complete universe into one canonical long-form panel and
   compute the candidate once.
3. Audit causality by recomputing selected whole-panel timestamp prefixes and
   comparing values already emitted by the full-history computation.
4. Fix 60/20/20 boundaries from the dataset timeline, independently of
   candidate warm-up and coverage.
5. Load the immutable Horizon Mandate, compute its primary and diagnostic
   close-to-close forward returns, and purge signal rows whose target would
   cross a split boundary.
6. Select the immutable evaluation mode from the prediction population:
   within-split temporal Spearman/Pearson for exactly one request-bound
   decision asset; within-split temporal Spearman/Pearson between the
   first-minus-second factor and forward-return contrasts for exactly two
   symmetric, two-sided, dollar-neutral decision assets; or per-timestamp
   cross-sectional association for four or more assets. Three require an
   explicit caller-owned relative-basket contrast.
7. For temporal modes, preflight the exact purged primary validation pairs and
   fail with a stable observation-count, candidate-variation, or
   target-variation diagnostic before numeric objective conversion.
8. Aggregate chronological train, validation, test, HAC, decay, fixed-style,
   per-asset, fold, and causal-regime diagnostics. Fixed tertiles and declared
   component attribution apply only to the cross-sectional mode in V1.
9. Publish finite primary `validation_mean_ic`, diagnostic test metrics, a
   research-integrity declaration, a JSON tear sheet, and exact daily CSV
   evidence.

The primary score is validation mean IC at
`primaryForwardBars` only. Test IC and every non-primary horizon are visible
diagnostic evidence and never enter candidate selection. Exact aggregation,
minimum population, and integrity rules live in the fixed Judge source and are
content-hashed with every Run. See
[[docs/design/research-selection-integrity]]. Diagnostic definitions and
artifact reconciliation are fixed by [[docs/design/factor-diagnostics]].

The causality audit is a misuse detector, not a proof against arbitrary hostile
Python. It reliably rejects common future leaks such as negative shifts,
centered windows, or full-sample normalizers whose past outputs change when
future rows are withheld.

## Synthetic fixture

The generated fixture is small, deterministic, and clearly labeled synthetic.
It contains multiple assets and a causal, discoverable relationship between a
current volume surprise and a later return, plus noise. This provides:

- a fast baseline suitable for routine tests;
- a known improvement path for KEEP verification;
- a stable no-lookahead regression target;
- no implication that the factor works on real markets.

Replacing it with real data is a Project-local action. Once files covered by
the Study dataset closure change, existing Sessions become stale and new Runs
receive a new dataset identity.

## Invariants

1. Template construction is atomic with ordinary Project discovery.
2. Created Projects are self-contained and never depend on mutable template
   files.
3. Candidate authority excludes Judge, Study, program, and data bytes.
4. Forward returns and split boundaries are computed only by the fixed Judge.
5. Validation and test periods are chronological and purge-aware, never random
   row splits or candidate-dependent dates.
6. Candidate selection uses validation only; visible test evidence requires a
   new external holdout after test-guided iteration.
7. Data file hashes are preserved in new immutable Run evidence.
8. Routine validation remains bounded and does not invoke a multi-year
   backtest.
9. Missing input, observed neutral zero, insufficient temporal variation, and
   a fixed conditional price-event population remain distinct semantics.

## Known limits

- The CSV format is a reference fixture contract, not a production ingestion
  standard.
- Cross-sectional factor quality is not a tradable portfolio return.
- Two-asset relative-value quality is the temporal association of one
  equal-funded dollar-neutral contrast. It is not beta neutrality and does
  not model borrow availability, borrow fees, or financing.
- HAC, quantile, style, asset, fold, and regime slices are diagnostics; they do
  not remove multiple-testing risk or become extra promotion objectives.
- The Judge does not model fees, fills, position limits, corporate actions, or
  exchange calendars.
- One scalar panel factor function is evaluated at a time. Formal
  fit/freeze/predict model lifecycles remain separate governed ML work rather
  than implicit state inside this function.
- A Factor candidate, including a sparse binary one, answers a continuous
  association question. Fixed OHLCV event selection, delayed outcome,
  overlap, and matched-reference questions use
  [[docs/design/ohlcv-price-event-study]] instead.
