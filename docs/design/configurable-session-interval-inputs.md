## Purpose

Multi-interval factors need two independent pieces of time authority:

1. the decision/base bar duration;
2. the market clock that defines which closes should exist and how higher bars
   complete.

V2 proved the interface for continuous UTC `1h` data. V3 makes those
authorities explicit without turning interval parsing into a strategy-owned
DSL.

## Compatibility

- V1 remains one daily session row per asset.
- V2 remains continuous UTC `1h` with
  `complete-utc-midnight-bar-close-v1`.
- V3 carries configurable base/feature intervals and either continuous UTC or
  XNYS regular-session authority.

Loaders dispatch by snapshot schema version. Existing V2 objects are rebuilt
with their original constants and byte identity.

## Canonical interval algebra

Public identifiers use this bounded order:

```text
1m 5m 15m 30m 1h 3h 4h 6h 12h 1d
```

Continuous bases may be any identifier below `1d`. A feature interval must be
larger than the base and its duration must be an exact multiple.

XNYS V3 initially accepts bases through `1h`. Intraday feature intervals may
be larger supported identifiers up to `6h`; `1d` means one complete exchange
session. `12h` is rejected because it is indistinguishable from a session bar
on the supported regular-session clock.

## Continuous clock

Continuous input is timezone-aware UTC and must contain every exact base close
without a gap. Higher intervals use UTC-midnight-anchored complete buckets.
No incomplete bucket is emitted.

The V3 method is:

```text
complete-continuous-utc-midnight-bar-close-v2
```

## XNYS session clock

The first session implementation accepts:

```json
{
  "clock": "session",
  "calendar": "XNYS",
  "timezone": "America/New_York"
}
```

AutoQuant obtains regular-session opens/closes from a pinned
`exchange-calendars` version. Input must consist of complete sessions. For
each session, expected base closes are:

```text
min(open + n × base_duration, scheduled_close)
```

This handles:

- the UTC shift around US daylight-saving transitions;
- scheduled holidays and weekends;
- 13:00 local early closes;
- a final short base bar when the nominal duration does not divide the
  session.

Extra premarket/after-hours rows, missing expected closes, partial first/last
sessions, and unscheduled timestamps fail intake.

Higher intraday buckets use the same open anchor and scheduled-close terminal
rule. The last short bucket is a completed bar, not a forming bar, because the
exchange session has ended. Daily aggregation consumes the entire verified
session and closes at the exact scheduled market close.

The V3 method is:

```text
complete-xnys-regular-session-bar-close-v1
```

## Candidate pandas surface

The API stays unchanged:

```python
def compute_factor(frame: pandas.DataFrame) -> pandas.Series:
    ...
```

Base OHLCV keeps unqualified names. Each feature interval contributes:

```text
bar_close__1h open__1h high__1h low__1h close__1h volume__1h age_bars__1h
bar_close__1d open__1d high__1d low__1d close__1d volume__1d age_bars__1d
```

`age_bars__*` counts decision/base rows since the source bar close rather than
wall-clock duration. It therefore remains meaningful over overnight,
weekend, DST, and early-close boundaries.

## Identity and verification

The V3 interval surface records:

- base and ordered feature intervals;
- timestamp semantics;
- market clock, calendar, and timezone;
- aggregation method and anchor;
- terminal bucket policy.

The package manifest, source hashes, materialized per-interval files, snapshot,
Study dataset hash, RunResult, Reports, Dossier, and holdout compatibility all
retain that authority.

The calendar library does not own evidence. Its pinned version enters
`uv.lock` and Harness identity; the resulting expected closes and aggregated
OHLCV are independently verified by AutoQuant whenever intake or a Run is
loaded.

## Annualization

Intraday Portfolio and RL metrics annualize from the verified decision clock:

- continuous bars use `365 days / base duration`;
- XNYS bars use `252 × expected bars per regular session`, including the
  explicit terminal partial base bar.

Daily V1 behavior remains 252.

## Known limits

- XNYS regular sessions only; no extended hours or halts.
- No futures/FX calendars or sessions crossing UTC dates.
- Schedule rules are only as authoritative as the pinned calendar version and
  caller/provider claims.
- This feature changes research input cadence, not live Broker execution
  authority.
